This extension will render unformatted links to Drupal.org issues to clearly indicate node id, title, and issue status. This closely mimic's Drupal.org's own rendering of links to issues, bringing the same formatting to ANY website.

Specifically, the extension will render links where both the anchor contents and href point to a Drupal.org issue.

For example. https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/1308152 would become "#1308152: Add stream wrappers to access extension files" and would be colored appropriately.

You can find and install this extension in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drupal-issue-chrome/hkgdkgbnhjmnplfpcdjhonlgilklepnm?hl=en&gl=US).

You may file issues and contribute to this [extension on GitHub](https://github.com/grasmash/drupal-issue-chrome).
